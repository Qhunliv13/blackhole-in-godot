I. DEFINITIONS

1.1 "Personal Use" means use solely for individual learning, study, and 
    experimentation purposes, without any intent to gain personal recognition, 
    awards, honors, or competitive advantage.
    
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - Solo personal learning and experimentation: No need to display repository URL
    - Any demonstration, sharing, or collaboration involving 2+ people: MUST display 
      project repository URL
    
    EDUCATIONAL EXCEPTION: Personal Use includes use in non-profit educational 
    institutions for non-competitive coursework and assignments, PROVIDED THAT:
    - The use is not for the purpose of rankings, competitive evaluation, or 
      comparisons between students
    - The use is not for scholarship awards, merit-based selection processes, 
      or academic honors
    - The use is not for academic competitions or contests
    - The use does not result in quantifiable benefits such as awards, prizes, 
      grades that determine rankings, or admission qualifications
    - The project repository URL (https://github.com/Qhunliv13/blackhole-in-godot) 
      MUST be visibly displayed in any submitted work, presentation, or documentation
    
    For clarity: Non-competitive homework, learning projects, and practice 
    assignments that receive only pass/fail grades or basic feedback (without 
    ranking or competition against other students) are permitted under Personal Use.
    
    TWO-OR-MORE-PERSON DISPLAY RULE:
    In any situation involving demonstration, sharing, or collaboration with 2 or 
    more people, regardless of whether quantifiable benefits are obtained, the 
    project repository URL link MUST be retained at minimum. This includes but is 
    not limited to:
    - Team collaboration or learning
    - Demonstrations to colleagues or classmates
    - Group discussions or sharing sessions
    - Presentations to clients or users
    - Any form of public or semi-public display

1.2 "Commercial Use" means any use of the Software for profit-generating 
    purposes, including but not limited to: selling, licensing, providing as 
    a paid service, or incorporating into commercial products or services.

1.3 "Non-Profit Organization" means an organization or group that does not 
    pursue monetary profit as its primary purpose, including but not limited to:
    - Registered non-profit organizations, charities, foundations
    - Public and private educational institutions (schools, universities, 
      libraries, training centers, etc.)
    - Open source communities, technical communities, academic research groups
    - Public benefit organizations, volunteer groups, interest groups
    
    DETERMINATION CRITERIA:
    The core criterion for a non-profit organization is that its activities are
    not primarily aimed at generating monetary profit, and any revenue is mainly
    used for the organization's operations and development rather than distribution
    to individuals or shareholders.
    
    NO PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED:
    Organizations meeting the non-profit criteria may use the Software directly
    without prior application to or registration with the copyright holder. However,
    the copyright holder reserves the right to request proof of non-profit status
    if abuse is discovered.
    
    DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
    If the copyright holder questions an organization's non-profit status, the
    organization should provide within a reasonable time one of the following:
    - Official registration documents or tax exemption certificates
    - Organizational charter or operational documents proving non-profit nature
    - Financial statements or other evidence showing no profit distribution
    - A reasonable written statement explaining its non-profit nature
    
    If the organization cannot provide reasonable proof, the copyright holder may
    require it to use the Software under commercial use terms.

1.4 "Derivative Work" means any work based upon the Software or modifications 
    thereof, including but not limited to: modifications, enhancements, 
    translations, adaptations, or any work that contains identifiable portions 
    of the Software. This includes forked versions on GitHub or other platforms.
    
    IMPORTANT - INTERFACE ISOLATION EXEMPTION (Ensuring Openness):
    Derivative Work does NOT include:
    - Software that runs this Software as an independent, separate process and 
      communicates with it solely through well-defined interfaces such as:
      • REST API, HTTP/HTTPS protocols
      • Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis, etc.)
      • RPC (gRPC, Thrift, etc.)
      • Standard I/O, pipes, or sockets
      • Microservices architecture with network boundaries
      • Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes) with API communication
    
    Clarification for Openness:
    If you package this QHPL-licensed Software as an independent service/process 
    and your main program communicates with it through standard interfaces WITHOUT 
    copying, modifying, or incorporating its source code, your main program is NOT 
    considered a Derivative Work and does NOT need to adopt this license.
    
    This exemption ensures maximum openness and interoperability while protecting 
    the Software itself.
    
    However, such interface-isolated use MUST still comply with:
    - Attribution requirements (Section 2.4) if publicly displayed
    - Competition prohibition (Section IV) - cannot be used in competitions
    - Commercial use requirements (Section 2.3) if applicable
    - All other restrictions except license inheritance
    
    ADDITIONAL OPENNESS - OUTPUT USE:
    If you only use the outputs, results, or data generated BY this Software
    (not running it as a service), see Section 1.7(B) - you only need attribution,
    with no other restrictions.

1.5 "Competition" means any organized activity where use of the Software is 
    intended to gain QUANTIFIABLE benefits, specifically including but not limited 
    to: monetary prizes, rankings with numerical/letter grades, medals/trophies, 
    certificates of achievement, scholarship qualifications, admission offers, 
    employment offers, or other measurable competitive advantages.
    
    SPECIFIC INCLUSIONS (Non-Exhaustive List):
    - Programming contests and hackathons offering prizes, rankings, or awards 
      (including internal company hackathons with incentives)
    - Innovation, technology, scientific, or academic competitions with evaluation 
      and ranking systems
    - Business plan competitions and pitch contests with judges and awards
    - School coursework, assignments, or projects where grades are determined by 
      competitive evaluation, rankings, or comparison between students (e.g., 
      "top 3 projects receive A+")
    - Community coding challenges with leaderboards, rankings, or achievement badges
    - Any organized event where participants are formally evaluated, scored, 
      ranked, or compared for the purpose of determining winners, awards, or 
      competitive placement
    
    SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS (Reverse Clarification):
    Competition does NOT include:
    (a) Non-competitive technical presentations, demonstrations, or sharing 
        sessions without evaluation, judging, or ranking 
        (MUST display project repository URL)
    (b) Internal study groups, learning circles, or collaborative projects 
        without scoring, grading, or competitive evaluation
        (If 2+ people involved, MUST display project repository URL)
    (c) Portfolio showcases, personal blogs, or social media posts that receive 
        only informal feedback, likes, or comments
        (MUST display project repository URL)
    (d) Professional work as an employee where the Software is a tool for 
        completing assigned duties (not competing for position/promotion)
        (If demonstrating to colleagues/clients, MUST retain repository URL link)
    
    IMPORTANT REMINDER: In any demonstration, sharing, or collaboration scenario 
    involving 2 or more people, even if it does not constitute a Competition, 
    the project repository URL link MUST be retained at minimum. For non-quantifiable 
    benefits (such as verbal praise, community recognition, informal feedback, etc.), 
    as long as it involves showing to others, the project repository URL must be displayed.
    
    CLARIFICATION ON UNCERTAINTY:
    If you are uncertain whether your intended use constitutes a Competition, 
    the determining factors are:
    - Is there an organized structure with rules and evaluation criteria?
    - Will participants be formally compared, ranked, or scored?
    - Are there quantifiable benefits (prizes, grades, rankings, awards)?
    If the answer to ALL three questions is YES, it is a Competition.

1.6 "Public Display" means any exhibition, demonstration, public release, 
    online distribution, presentation, or other form of public showing of 
    the Software or Derivative Works.

1.7 "Indirect Use" vs "Output Use" - Important Distinction:
    
    A. INDIRECT USE (Subject to All License Terms):
       - Integrating the Software as a backend service, API, or component where 
         the Software runs continuously as part of your system
       - Your application depends on the Software being actively running to provide 
         its core functionality
       - Wrapping or encapsulating the Software to provide services to your users
    
    B. OUTPUT USE (Only Requires Attribution):
       Using outputs, results, or data generated BY the Software does NOT constitute 
       Indirect Use. This includes:
       - Using datasets, visualizations, or simulation results generated by the Software
       - Training machine learning models on data produced by the Software
       - Using computational results or analysis output from the Software
       - Incorporating images, videos, or renders created by the Software
       
       For OUTPUT USE, you only need to:
       - Provide reasonable attribution citing the source (e.g., "Generated using 
         https://github.com/Qhunliv13/blackhole-in-godot")
       - No license inheritance required
       - No commercial display requirements beyond attribution
       - Competition prohibition still applies: outputs cannot be used to gain 
         competitive advantages in competitions (see Section IV)
    
    C. INDEPENDENT IMPLEMENTATION (Not Covered by This License):
       - Independently designed and implemented new code inspired by but not copying 
         this Software's code
       - Independent development using completely different technical approaches
       - Independent implementations based on publicly known scientific principles, 
         mathematical formulas, or general algorithms (not specific expressions 
         unique to this Software)
    
    CLARITY FOR OPENNESS:
    Running the Software as a tool to generate outputs for your own use is encouraged.
    You can freely use those outputs with only attribution, promoting knowledge 
    sharing and reducing propagation barriers.

     SPECIAL PROVISION FOR THIS SPECIFIC REPOSITORY:
     This particular repository (https://github.com/Qhunliv13/blackhole-in-godot) 
     was previously distributed under the MIT License. To address this historical 
     licensing situation, ALL users of this specific repository (including those 
     who obtained the Software under the previous MIT license) MUST comply with 
     the current QHPL-1.4 license version.
     
     This special mandatory update provision applies ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY to 
     https://github.com/Qhunliv13/blackhole-in-godot due to its previous MIT 
     license status. By continuing to use, modify, or distribute this Software 
     after the effective date of this license (November 2025), you agree to be 
     bound by the current license terms, regardless of when you initially obtained 
     the Software or under which previous license.
     
     For any other projects or repositories using this license: This mandatory 
     update provision does NOT apply. Standard version update rules apply as 
     described below.
     
     NOTE: The Chinese version of this license is the legally binding version.
     This English version is for reference only. Please refer to the Chinese

       - 公开发布或大范围展示：按照本节完整要求执行，包含可见展示和署名
    
    合理遵守与举证：
    展示要求应根据实际情况合理履行。版权持有人理解在某些非正式场合
    （如临时性的小型讨论、内部测试等）可能难以严格满足所有展示要求。
    
    如果版权持有人发现公开展示、发布或分发本软件的行为未包含项目仓库地址
    或署名信息，应首先通知使用者并给予合理的补正机会（参见第VIII节终止条款）。
