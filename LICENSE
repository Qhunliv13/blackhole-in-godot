I. DEFINITIONS

1.1 "Personal Use" means use solely for individual learning, study, and 
    experimentation purposes, without any intent to gain personal recognition, 
    awards, honors, or competitive advantage.
    
    IMPORTANT NOTES (Tiered Display Requirements):
    
    A. NO repository URL required:
       - Solo personal learning and experimentation
       - Small-scale technical research, academic discussion, or learning exchange (≤6 people)
       - Informal discussions among roommates, lab members, study groups
       - Internal technical discussions within organization (non-evaluative, non-formal)
    
    B. Reasonable attribution recommended:
       - Internal technical sharing within organization (>6 people but <20 people)
       - Team internal technical training or knowledge transfer
       - Mentioning in code comments, documentation, or verbal explanation is sufficient
    
    C. MUST clearly display repository URL:
       - Public or external audience display
       - Large public events, conferences, seminars (≥20 people)
       - Publishing on public platforms, social media, technical blogs
       - Presentations to clients, partners, external consultants
       - Used for evaluation, assessment, performance review, promotion decisions
       - Formal business reports to management
    
    EDUCATIONAL EXCEPTION: Personal Use includes use in non-profit educational 
    institutions for non-competitive coursework and assignments, PROVIDED THAT:
    - The use is not for the purpose of rankings, competitive evaluation, or 
      comparisons between students
    - The use is not for scholarship awards, merit-based selection processes, 
      or academic honors
    - The use is not for academic competitions or contests
    - The use does not result in quantifiable benefits such as awards, prizes, 
      grades that determine rankings, or admission qualifications
    - The project repository URL (see header for repository address) 
      MUST be visibly displayed in any submitted work, presentation, or documentation
    
    For clarity: Non-competitive homework, learning projects, and practice 
    assignments that receive only pass/fail grades or basic feedback (without 
    ranking or competition against other students) are permitted under Personal Use.
    
    TWO-OR-MORE-PERSON DISPLAY RULE:
    In any situation involving demonstration, sharing, or collaboration with 2 or 
    more people, regardless of whether quantifiable benefits are obtained, the 
    project repository URL link MUST be retained at minimum. This includes but is 
    not limited to:
    - Team collaboration or learning
    - Demonstrations to colleagues or classmates
    - Group discussions or sharing sessions
    - Presentations to clients or users
    - Any form of public or semi-public display

1.2 "Commercial Use" means any use of the Software for profit-generating 
    purposes, including but not limited to: selling, licensing, providing as 
    a paid service, or incorporating into commercial products or services.

1.3 "Non-Profit Organization" means an organization or group that does not 
    pursue monetary profit as its primary purpose, including but not limited to:
    - Registered non-profit organizations, charities, foundations
    - Public and private educational institutions (schools, universities, 
      libraries, training centers, etc.)
    - Open source communities, technical communities, academic research groups
    - Public benefit organizations, volunteer groups, interest groups
    
    DETERMINATION CRITERIA:
    The core criterion for a non-profit organization is that its activities are
    not primarily aimed at generating monetary profit, and any revenue is mainly
    used for the organization's operations and development rather than distribution
    to individuals or shareholders.
    
    NO PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED:
    Organizations meeting the non-profit criteria may use the Software directly
    without prior application to or registration with the copyright holder. However,
    the copyright holder reserves the right to request proof of non-profit status
    if abuse is discovered.
    
    DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
    If the copyright holder questions an organization's non-profit status, the
    organization should provide within a reasonable time one of the following:
    - Official registration documents or tax exemption certificates
    - Organizational charter or operational documents proving non-profit nature
    - Financial statements or other evidence showing no profit distribution
    - A reasonable written statement explaining its non-profit nature
    
    If the organization cannot provide reasonable proof, the copyright holder may
    require it to use the Software under commercial use terms.

1.4 "Derivative Work" means any work based upon the Software or modifications 
    thereof, including but not limited to: modifications, enhancements, 
    translations, adaptations, or any work that contains identifiable portions 
    of the Software. This includes forked versions on GitHub or other platforms.
    
    IMPORTANT - INTERFACE ISOLATION EXEMPTION (Ensuring Openness):
    Derivative Work does NOT include:
    - Software that runs this Software as an independent, separate process and 
      communicates with it solely through well-defined interfaces such as:
      • REST API, HTTP/HTTPS protocols
      • Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis, etc.)
      • RPC (gRPC, Thrift, etc.)
      • Standard I/O, pipes, or sockets
      • Microservices architecture with network boundaries
      • Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes) with API communication
    
    Clarification for Openness:
    If you package this QHPL-licensed Software as an independent service/process 
    and your main program communicates with it through standard interfaces WITHOUT 
    copying, modifying, or incorporating its source code, your main program is NOT 
    considered a Derivative Work and does NOT need to adopt this license.
    
    This exemption ensures maximum openness and interoperability while protecting 
    the Software itself.
    
    However, such interface-isolated use MUST still comply with:
    - Attribution requirements (Section 2.4) if publicly displayed
    - Competition attribution requirements (Section IV) - must disclose use in 
      competition materials
    - Commercial use requirements (Section 2.3) if applicable
    - All other restrictions except license inheritance
    
    ADDITIONAL OPENNESS - OUTPUT USE:
    If you only use the outputs, results, or data generated BY this Software
    (not running it as a service), see Section 1.7(B) - you only need attribution,
    with minimal restrictions.

1.5 "Competition" means any organized activity where use of the Software is 
    intended to gain QUANTIFIABLE benefits, specifically including but not limited 
    to: monetary prizes, rankings with numerical/letter grades, medals/trophies, 
    certificates of achievement, scholarship qualifications, admission offers, 
    employment offers, or other measurable competitive advantages.
    
    SPECIFIC INCLUSIONS (Non-Exhaustive List):
    - Programming contests and hackathons offering prizes, rankings, or awards 
      (including internal company hackathons with incentives)
    - Innovation, technology, scientific, or academic competitions with evaluation 
      and ranking systems
    - Business plan competitions and pitch contests with judges and awards
    - School coursework, assignments, or projects where grades are determined by 
      competitive evaluation, rankings, or comparison between students (e.g., 
      "top 3 projects receive A+")
    - Community coding challenges with leaderboards, rankings, or achievement badges
    - Any organized event where participants are formally evaluated, scored, 
      ranked, or compared for the purpose of determining winners, awards, or 
      competitive placement
    
    SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS (Reverse Clarification):
    Competition does NOT include:
    (a) Non-competitive technical presentations, demonstrations, or sharing 
        sessions without evaluation, judging, or ranking 
        (MUST display project repository URL)
    (b) Internal study groups, learning circles, or collaborative projects 
        without scoring, grading, or competitive evaluation
        (If 2+ people involved, MUST display project repository URL)
    (c) Portfolio showcases, personal blogs, or social media posts that receive 
        only informal feedback, likes, or comments
        (MUST display project repository URL)
    (d) Professional work as an employee where the Software is a tool for 
        completing assigned duties (not competing for position/promotion)
        (If demonstrating to colleagues/clients, MUST retain repository URL link)
    
    IMPORTANT REMINDER: In any demonstration, sharing, or collaboration scenario 
    involving 2 or more people, even if it does not constitute a Competition, 
    the project repository URL link MUST be retained at minimum. For non-quantifiable 
    benefits (such as verbal praise, community recognition, informal feedback, etc.), 
    as long as it involves showing to others, the project repository URL must be displayed.
    
    CLARIFICATION ON UNCERTAINTY:
    If you are uncertain whether your intended use constitutes a Competition, 
    the determining factors are:
    - Is there an organized structure with rules and evaluation criteria?
    - Will participants be formally compared, ranked, or scored?
    - Are there quantifiable benefits (prizes, grades, rankings, awards)?
    If the answer to ALL three questions is YES, it is a Competition.

1.6 "Public Display" means any exhibition, demonstration, public release, 
    online distribution, presentation, or other form of public showing of 
    the Software or Derivative Works.

1.7 "Indirect Use" vs "Output Use" - Important Distinction:
    
    A. INDIRECT USE (Subject to All License Terms):
       - Integrating the Software as a backend service, API, or component where 
         the Software runs continuously as part of your system
       - Your application depends on the Software being actively running to provide 
         its core functionality
       - Wrapping or encapsulating the Software to provide services to your users
    
    B. OUTPUT USE (Only Requires Attribution):
       Using outputs, results, or data generated BY the Software does NOT constitute 
       Indirect Use. This includes:
       - Using datasets, visualizations, or simulation results generated by the Software
       - Training machine learning models on data produced by the Software
       - Using computational results or analysis output from the Software
       - Incorporating images, videos, or renders created by the Software
       
       For OUTPUT USE, you only need to:
       - Provide reasonable attribution citing the source (e.g., "Generated using 
         [project repository, see license header]")
       - No license inheritance required
       - No commercial display requirements beyond attribution
       - Competition use requires attribution: if using outputs in competitions, 
         must acknowledge the source in competition materials (see Section IV)
    
    C. INDEPENDENT IMPLEMENTATION (Not Covered by This License):
       - Independently designed and implemented new code inspired by but not copying 
         this Software's code
       - Independent development using completely different technical approaches
       - Independent implementations based on publicly known scientific principles, 
         mathematical formulas, or general algorithms (not specific expressions 
         unique to this Software)
    
    CLARITY FOR OPENNESS:
    Running the Software as a tool to generate outputs for your own use is encouraged.
    You can freely use those outputs with only attribution, promoting knowledge 
    sharing and reducing propagation barriers.
    
    SPECIFIC SCENARIOS CLARIFIED:
    - API Calls: If you only call the Software through its API without distributing 
      it, you need attribution only when publicly displaying results (see Section 2.4)
    - Artwork/Visualizations: Images, videos, renders, or other creative outputs 
      generated by the Software only require simple attribution (e.g., "Created with 
      [Software Name]" or crediting in description/metadata)
    - Data Processing: Using the Software to process data and using the processed 
      results only requires attribution when publishing or sharing those results
    
    The license aims to be permissive for legitimate use while preventing abuse.

    understand you used this Software. One clear attribution is sufficient.
    
    VIOLATIONS:
    The following constitute violations:
    - Deliberately omitting ALL attribution to gain unfair advantage
    - Explicitly claiming the Software's functionality as entirely your own work
    - Actively concealing the use of this Software when directly asked
    - Removing all copyright notices or license information
    
    CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION:
    Violation of competition attribution requirements will result in license termination 
    subject to the cure period in Section 8.1C, and may be reported to competition 
    organizers as academic/professional misconduct.

4.1a Flexible Arrangements for Competition Use
    NEGOTIATION OPTION:
    If the standard attribution requirements in Section 4.1 are impractical or 
    problematic for your specific competition scenario, you may contact the 
    copyright holder to discuss alternative arrangements.
    
    Negotiable aspects may include:
    - Modified attribution format suitable for your competition's requirements
    - Alternative disclosure methods that satisfy both parties
    - Timing or placement of attribution in competition materials
    - Special considerations for unique competition formats
    
    To request negotiation:
    - Contact through the project GitHub repository (see header for repository address)
    - Provide details about the competition (name, organizer, dates, rules)
    - Explain your specific situation and proposed attribution approach
    - Request discussion BEFORE the competition begins
    
    The copyright holder will make reasonable efforts to accommodate legitimate 
    requests while maintaining the principles of transparency and proper attribution.
    Absence of response does not constitute permission - you must receive explicit 
    written agreement for any deviation from standard requirements.

4.2 Prohibited Modifications
    You may NOT:
    - Remove or alter any copyright notices, license terms, or attribution
    - Remove or obscure required repository URL displays
    - Sublicense the Software under different terms
    - Use the Software in any manner that violates this license

VIII. TERMINATION

8.1 Termination Process
    A. NOTICE AND CURE PERIOD:
       If you violate any terms or conditions of this license (except as specified 
       in subsection B below), the copyright holder shall provide written notice 
       of the violation to you. You shall have THIRTY (30) DAYS from receipt of 
       such notice to cure the violation.
       
       If you successfully cure the violation within the 30-day period and provide 
       reasonable evidence of compliance to the copyright holder, the license shall 
       continue in full force and effect.
       
       If you fail to cure the violation within the 30-day period, your rights 
       under this license will terminate automatically at the end of the cure period.
    
    B. IMMEDIATE TERMINATION (No Cure Period):
       Your rights under this license will terminate IMMEDIATELY and AUTOMATICALLY 
       without any cure period if you:
       - Remove or alter copyright notices, license terms, or attribution with 
         intent to conceal the source
       - Sublicense the Software under different terms
       - Engage in willful and material breach with intent to deceive
       
       These violations are considered fundamental breaches that cannot be cured, 
       and termination is immediate upon occurrence.
    
    C. COMPETITION USE VIOLATIONS (Special Cure Period):
       For violations of competition attribution requirements (Section IV):
       - The copyright holder SHALL provide written notice of the violation
       - User has 30 days to cure by adding proper attribution to competition materials
       - If remediation is impossible due to competition completion, user must:
         a) Acknowledge the violation in writing
         b) Commit to proper attribution in future uses
         c) Pay reasonable consideration if requested by copyright holder
       - The copyright holder may, at their sole discretion, offer alternative 
         remediation approaches through negotiation
       - Good-faith compliance efforts will be considered favorably
    
    D. WRITTEN NOTICE REQUIREMENTS:
       All notices under this Section must be in writing and delivered via:
       - Email to any contact information associated with your use of the Software
       - Issues or pull requests on your public repository if the Software is 
         publicly distributed
       - Registered mail to any known address
       
       Notice is deemed received 3 business days after sending.

    - You must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession
    - You must cease distribution of any Derivative Works
    - You may face legal action for license violations
    - Any Derivative Works you created remain subject to this license

8.3 Survival
    Sections IV (Prohibited Uses), VI (Disclaimer), VII (Limitation of 
    Liability), IX (Governing Law), and X (General Provisions) survive 
    termination of this license.

8.4 Notice-and-Remediation Mechanism (Fair Procedure)
    For violations on online platforms or third-party services:
    
    A. Initial Contact and Good Faith Dialogue:
       Before requesting platform intervention, the copyright holder SHOULD:
       - Attempt to contact the user directly through available channels
       - Provide specific description of the alleged violation
       - Allow the user reasonable opportunity to explain or remediate (at least 7 days)
       - Only proceed to platform notification if direct contact fails or user 
         refuses to engage
    
    B. Formal Violation Notice:
       If direct contact is unsuccessful, the copyright holder may submit a formal 
       violation notice to the platform. The notice must include:
       - Copyright holder's identity proof and contact information
       - Identification information of this Software (repository URL, version, etc.)
       - Specific location of violating content (URL, account, project name, etc.)
       - Specific description of violation with evidence
       - Documentation of attempt to contact user directly (if applicable)
       - Statement made in good faith that the notice contents are true and accurate
    
    C. User's Remediation Rights and Obligations:
       Users receiving violation notices have 30 calendar days to:
       - Respond explaining their compliance with the license
       - Complete remediation and provide evidence
       - Request clarification if the violation is unclear
       - Negotiate remediation approach with copyright holder
       
       Extension provisions:
       - Users may request extensions up to 360 days (12 months) for complex situations
       - Extensions granted based on: deployment complexity, good faith effort, 
         reasonable remediation plan
       - Users remain in compliance during active remediation period if engaging 
         in good faith
    
    D. Platform Cooperation (Balanced Approach):
       Platforms should:
       - Forward violation notices to users
       - Allow users full remediation period before taking action
       - Only remove content if: (a) user does not respond, (b) user refuses to 
         remediate, or (c) violation is egregious and deliberate
       - Restore content if user demonstrates compliance or completes remediation
    
    E. Counter-Notice and Dispute Resolution:
       Users may submit a counter-notice if they believe:
       - Their use complies with the license
       - Remediation has been completed
       - The notice is inaccurate or made in bad faith
       
       The copyright holder must respond to counter-notices within 14 days. If no 
       response or if parties cannot reach agreement, either party may invoke the 
       dispute resolution mechanism in Section IX.
    
    F. Anti-Abuse Protections:
       - Copyright holder submitting knowingly false notices may lose enforcement 
         rights and face liability
       - Users acting in bad faith to delay or avoid compliance may face immediate 
         termination
       - Both parties expected to engage honestly and constructively
       - Platforms not liable for good-faith compliance with proper notices

     SPECIAL PROVISION FOR THIS SPECIFIC REPOSITORY:
     This particular repository (https://github.com/Qhunliv13/blackhole-in-godot) 
     was previously distributed under the MIT License. To address this historical 
     licensing situation, ALL users of this specific repository (including those

     license status. By continuing to use, modify, or distribute this Software 
     after the effective date of this license (November 2025), you agree to be 
     bound by the current license terms, regardless of when you initially obtained 
     the Software or under which previous license.

      （见协议头部）
    
    明确说明：非竞争性作业、学习项目和练习作业，仅接受通过/不通过评分或
    基本反馈（无排名或与其他学生竞争）的，属于个人使用许可范围。

1.2 "商业使用"是指以营利为目的使用软件，包括但不限于：销售、许可、作为付费
    服务提供，或整合到商业产品或服务中。

1.3 "非营利组织"是指实际上不以金钱盈利为目的的组织或团体，包括但不限于：
    - 注册的非营利组织、慈善机构、基金会
    - 公立和私立教育机构（学校、大学、图书馆、培训机构等）
    - 开源社区、技术社群、学术研究团体
    - 公益性组织、志愿者团体、兴趣小组
    
    判定标准：
    非营利组织的核心判定标准是：组织的活动不以获取金钱利润为主要目的，
    且任何收入主要用于组织的运营和发展，而非分配给个人或股东。
    
    无需事前批准：
    符合非营利性质的组织可以直接使用本软件，无需事前向版权持有人申请或备案。
    但版权持有人保留在发现滥用时要求提供非营利性质证明的权利。
    
    争议处理：
    如果版权持有人对某组织的非营利性质提出质疑，该组织应在合理时间内提供
    以下证明之一：
    - 官方登记文件或税务免税证明
    - 组织章程或运营文件证明其非营利性质
    - 财务报表或其他证据证明无营利分配
    - 合理的书面声明解释其非营利性质
    
    如组织无法提供合理证明，版权持有人可要求其按照商业使用条款使用软件。

1.4 "衍生作品"是指基于本软件或其修改的任何作品，包括但不限于：修改、增强、
    翻译、改编，或任何包含本软件可识别部分的作品。这包括 GitHub 或其他平台上的
    分叉版本。
    
    重要 - 接口隔离豁免条款（确保开放性）：
    衍生作品不包括：
    - 将本软件作为独立的、单独的进程运行，并仅通过明确定义的接口与其通信的软件，
      这些接口包括：
      • REST API、HTTP/HTTPS 协议
      • 消息队列（RabbitMQ、Kafka、Redis 等）
      • RPC（gRPC、Thrift 等）
      • 标准 I/O、管道或套接字
      • 具有网络边界的微服务架构
      • 通过 API 通信的容器编排（Docker、Kubernetes）
    
    开放性说明：
    如果您将本 QHPL 许可的软件打包为独立的服务/进程，您的主程序通过标准接口
    与其通信，且未复制、修改或合并其源代码，则您的主程序不被视为衍生作品，
    无需采用本许可证。
    
    此豁免确保了最大程度的开放性和互操作性，同时保护软件本身。
    
    但是，这种接口隔离的使用仍必须遵守：
    - 署名要求（第2.4节）如果公开展示
    - 比赛署名要求（第四节）- 必须在比赛材料中披露使用情况
    - 商业使用要求（第2.3节）如适用
    - 除许可证继承外的所有其他限制
    
    额外的开放性 - 输出使用：
    如果您仅使用本软件生成的输出、结果或数据（而非将其作为服务运行），
    请参见第1.7条(B) - 您仅需署名，限制最少。

1.5 "比赛"是指任何有组织的活动，使用本软件的目的是获得可量化的利益。
    
    "可量化的利益"包括但不限于：
    - 金钱奖励（奖金、奖品、代金券等）
    - 数字/字母等级排名（名次、分数、评级等）
    - 实物奖励（奖牌、奖杯、证书、纪念品等）
    - 教育相关利益（奖学金、录取资格、学分加分、保研资格等）
    - 职业相关利益（实习机会、就业机会、内推资格、晋升机会、工作推荐信等）
    - 荣誉性利益（头衔、称号、公开表彰、媒体曝光、官方认证等）
    - 平台权益（积分、等级、徽章、会员资格、优先权等）
    - 资源性利益（云服务额度、软件许可、设备赠送、培训机会等）
    - 其他任何可以转化为实际优势或特权的利益
    
    具体包括（非详尽列表）：
    - 提供奖金、排名或奖项的编程竞赛和黑客马拉松（包括提供激励的公司内部黑客马拉松）
    - 具有评估和排名系统的创新、技术、科学或学术竞赛
    - 有评委和奖项的商业计划竞赛和路演比赛
    - 根据竞争性评估、排名或学生之间比较来决定成绩的学校课程作业、任务或项目
      （例如"前 3 名项目获得 A+"）
    - 具有排行榜、排名或成就徽章的社区编程挑战
    - 任何有组织的活动，参与者被正式评估、评分、排名或比较，以确定获胜者、
      奖项或竞争性名次
    
    具体排除（反向澄清）：
    比赛不包括：
    (a) 无评估、评判或排名的非竞争性技术演示、展示或分享会议
        （必须显示项目仓库地址）
    (b) 内部学习小组、学习圈或协作项目，无评分、打分或竞争性评估
        （如涉及2人或以上参与，必须显示项目仓库地址）
    (c) 作品集展示、个人博客或仅接收非正式反馈、点赞或评论的社交媒体帖子
        （必须显示项目仓库地址）
    (d) 作为员工的专业工作，软件是完成指定职责的工具（而非为职位/晋升竞争）
        （如涉及向同事或客户展示，必须保留项目地址链接）
    
    重要提示：凡涉及2人或以上的任何展示、分享、协作情况，即使不构成比赛，
    也必须至少保留项目仓库地址链接。对于不可量化的收益（如口头表扬、社区
    认可、非正式反馈等），只要涉及向他人展示，也必须显示项目仓库地址。
    
    不确定性说明：
    如果您不确定您的预期用途是否构成比赛，判定因素为：
    - 是否有具有规则和评估标准的组织结构？
    - 参与者是否会被正式比较、排名或评分？
    - 是否有可量化的利益（奖金、成绩、排名、奖项）？
    如果以上三个问题的答案都是"是"，则属于比赛。

1.6 "公众展示"是指对软件或衍生作品的任何展览、演示、公开发布、在线分发、
    演示文稿或其他形式的公开展示。

8.4 通知-整改机制（公平程序）
    针对在线平台或第三方服务上的违规使用：

       - 仅在直接联系失败或使用者拒绝沟通时才向平台提交通知

       如果直接联系不成功，版权持有人可向平台提交正式违规通知。通知必须包含：
       - 版权持有人的身份证明和联系方式

       - 如果诚信参与，使用者在主动整改期间仍保持合规状态
    
    D. 平台配合（平衡方式）：
       平台应当：
       - 将违规通知转发给使用者
       - 在采取行动前允许使用者完整的整改期限
       - 仅在以下情况删除内容：(a) 使用者不回应，(b) 使用者拒绝整改，
         或 (c) 违规行为严重且故意
       - 如使用者证明合规或完成整改，恢复内容
    
    E. 反通知与争议解决：
       使用者可提交反通知，如果他们认为：

       - 整改已完成
       - 通知不准确或出于恶意
       
       版权持有人必须在14天内回应反通知。如无回应或双方无法达成一致，
       任何一方可启用第九节的争议解决机制。
    
    F. 反滥用保护：
       - 版权持有人明知提交虚假通知可能失去执行权并承担责任

     的约束，无论您最初何时获得本软件或在何种先前许可证下获得。
